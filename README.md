## KDD Cup 99 Dataset

### Overview

The **KDD Cup 99** dataset is one of the most well-known datasets used in the field of intrusion detection and network security analysis. It was used in the KDD Cup competition in 1999 as part of research efforts to improve intrusion detection techniques.

### Dataset Contents

The KDD Cup 99 dataset consists of information about network traffic and includes 41 features describing each connection. Some of these features are:

- **duration**: Duration of the connection.
- **protocol_type**: Type of protocol (e.g., TCP, UDP, ICMP).
- **service**: The service used (e.g., HTTP, FTP, telnet).
- **flag**: Status of the connection (e.g., SF, REJ).
- **src_bytes**: Number of bytes sent from the source.
- **dst_bytes**: Number of bytes received at the destination.
- **num_failed_logins**: Number of failed login attempts.
- **logged_in**: Login status (0 or 1).
- **num_compromised**: Number of compromised accounts.
- **root_shell**: Status of root privileges.
- **normal.**: The target variable indicating whether the connection is normal (0) or an attack (1).

### Types of Attacks

The KDD Cup 99 dataset includes several types of attacks, such as:

- **DoS (Denial of Service)**: Attacks aimed at disrupting service.
- **R2L (Remote to Local)**: Attacks targeting remote access to the system.
- **U2R (User to Root)**: Attacks aimed at gaining root privileges.
- **Probe**: Attempts to explore the system.

### Usage

The KDD Cup 99 dataset is widely used to train machine learning models in the field of intrusion detection, providing balanced data between normal connections and attacks. Although this dataset is somewhat outdated, it remains an important reference in network security research.

### Notes

- While useful, the KDD Cup 99 dataset may have some caveats, such as data redundancy and a lack of representation for some modern attack patterns.
- It is preferable to use newer and more representative datasets in current research, such as the UNSW-NB15 dataset or the CICIDS dataset.
